   :caption: EFP, or the Effective Fragment Potential, is a polarizable quantum-mechanics-based model potential for predicting interaction energies between molecules. EFP describes the noncovalent interaction energy as a sum of Colomb, polarization, dispersion, exchange-repulsion and optional charge-transfer terms.
