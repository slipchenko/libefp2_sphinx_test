   :alt: EFP Overview

EFP, or the Effective Fragment Potential, is a polarizable quantum-mechanics-based model potential for predicting interaction energies between molecules. EFP describes the noncovalent interaction energy as a sum of Colomb, polarization, dispersion, exchange-repulsion and optional charge-transfer terms.

EFP calculations typically contain two major parts: preparing effective parameters for all unique parts of the system, and evaluating interaction energy of the molecular system.
