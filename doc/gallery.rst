This gallery highlights the use of EFP to bridge the gap between chemistry, biology, and physics, 
particularly in solving real-world challenges in drug design and photosynthesis. EFP plays a crucial 
role in understanding and optimizing these complex processes by providing detailed insights into 
molecular interactions.
