But wait, do I need to recompute fragment parameters for each new geometry of my
polymer? Not necessary, if you did a homework. Check out this paper on
`Flexible EFP <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b04166>`_.
A collection of scripts to help you set-up these jobs
is `Flexible EFP tutorial <https://github.itap.purdue.edu/Slipchenko-group/Flexible_EFP_scripts/>`_.
