The model is described `here <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b04166>`_.
The original work used the following script `step2.gen.gamess.pl` **Where is it?**.
For a new robust version of the script check out this
`BioEFP tutorial <https://github.itap.purdue.edu/Slipchenko-group/>`_ **The tutorial is not there yet!**
