How to prepare EFP parameters? There are two ways, either find existing parameters in a :ref:`parameter database` or :ref:`compute parameters`.

.. _parameter database:

Parameter database
------------------

Parameters of all monomers from S22 and S66 sets are available `here <https://github.com/libefp2/libefp/tree/master/fraglib/databases>`_.

Amino acid parameter database is `here <https://github.com/libefp2/libefp/tree/master/fraglib/flex_efp_protein>`_. This database consists of fragments describing amino acid residues and peptide back bone groups in different geometries, as described in the `Flexible EFP paper <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00758>`_. Parameters from the database should be matched to the geometry of your system. The strategy of rotating and shifting the parameters is described in `Flexible EFP paper <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00758>`_. The script that will do it for you `parameter rotation script <https://github.com/libefp2/libefp/blob/master/tools/Flexible_V5.py>`_.

Splitting of the protein into amino acid fragments and matching the parameters to specific geometries of the fragments with BioEFP and FlexEFP tutorials is described in :ref:`bioefp`.

.. _compute parameters:

Computing parameters
--------------------

Parameters for any molecule can be computed using MAKEFP run in the GAMESS electronic structure package.

For general information on using GAMESS please refer to the
`GAMESS manual <https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/GAMESS_Manual/docs-input.txt>`_.

Apart of standard `.log` and `.dat` outputs, MAKEFP run creates  an additional file with an extension `.efp`
that contains all EFP parameters of your molecule.

An example of GAMESS input file for computing EFP parameters can be found here :download:`makefp.inp <./examples/makefp.inp>`.

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/makefp.inp
  :linenos:

`.efp` parameter file
---------------------

.. note:: `.efp` file follows general GAMESS input file conventions:

   - Group names starting with ``$`` should start at the second line character.
   - Lines should not exceed 72 characters; use ``>`` as a continuation sign for longer lines.

An example of `.efp` file is here :download:`nh3.efp <./examples/nh3.efp>`.

The `.efp` file has the following structure (see also `$FRAGNAME group` section in GAMESS manual):

.. _FRAGNAME:

``$FRAGNAME``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``FRAGNAME`` section provides user-specified fragment name.
- The section is *mandatory*.
- ``FRAGNAME`` tag should match the fragment name in LibEFP, GAMESS, Q-Chem inputs.
  Capitalization is not important.
- ``FRAGNAME`` tag should match the name of the `.efp` file.
  For example, ``$nh3`` fragment should be contained in `nh3.efp` file.
- ``$`` in front of the ``FRAGNAME`` tag should be positioned at the second line character.


``Commment line``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The section is *mandatory*.

.. _COORD:

``COORDINATES``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``COORDINATES`` section provides coordinates of all atoms and bond-midpoints of the fragment.
- The section is *mandatory*.
- Each line contains name tag, x, y, z coordinates (in Bohr), atom mass, nuclear charge.
- For atoms, the name tag is produced as ``A`` + ``two-digit number`` + ``atom name`` from the MAKEFP input,
  e.g., A01N.
- For bond-midpoints, the name tag is produced as ``BO`` + ``second atom number`` + ``first atom number``,
  e.g., BO21.
- These name tags are used in ``MULTIPOLES``, ``DIPOLES``, ``QUADRUPOLES``, ``OCTUPOLES``, ``PROJECTION BASIS SET``, and
  ``SCREEN`` and ``SCREEN2`` sections.
- The name tags can be changed by user if needed (typically not needed, see below).
- GAMESS does not correctly assign name tags in fragments containing more than 99 atoms.
  Such potentials require atom and bond-midpoint renaming by user.
- The section ends with mandatory ``STOP`` line.

.. _MON:

``MONOPOLES``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``MONOPOLES`` section contains nuclear and electronic charges of atoms and bond-midpoints of the fragment.
- Each line contains name tag, electronic charge, nuclear charge.
- Name tags should match those in ``COORDINATES`` section.

- The section can contain less atoms/bond midpoints than ``COORDINATES`` section.
- The section ends with mandatory ``STOP`` line.

.. _DIP:

``DIPOLES``
^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``DIPOLES`` section contains point dipoles of atoms and bond-midpoints of the fragment.
- Each line contains name tag and x, y, z values of a point dipole in atomic units.

- Direction of the dipoles is dependent on the fragment orientation as provided by the fragment coordinates.
- The section ends with mandatory ``STOP`` line.

.. _QUAD:

``QUADRUPOLES``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``QUADRUPOLES`` section contains point quadrupoles of atoms and bond-midpoints of the fragment.
- Each line contains name tag and xx, yy, zz, xy, xz, yz components of a quadrupole
  moment tensor in atomic units. Three other elements (yx, zx, zy) are identical
  to xy, xz, yz respectively and are omitted.
- Name tags should match those in ``COORDINATES`` section.
- The section is optional.
- The section can contain less atoms/bond midpoints than ``COORDINATES`` section.
- Direction of the quadrupole tensor is dependent on the fragment orientation as provided by the fragment coordinates.
- The quadrupole moments are given in the Buckingham form, i.e.,  xx, xy, xz etc components correspond to
  :math:`a_x a_x`, :math:`a_x a_y`, :math:`a_x a_z`, respectively,
  where **a** is a vector describing particle position. Conversion to multipoles in the Cartesian form
  :math:`\Theta_{\alpha \beta} = \sum_a e_a (\frac{3}{2}a_{\alpha}a_{\beta}-\frac{1}{2}a^2\delta_{\alpha \beta})`
  is conducted within LibEFP or GAMESS codes.

- Direction of the quadrupole tensor is dependent on the fragment orientation as provided by the fragment coordinates.
- The octupole moments are given in the Buckingham form, e.g., xxx corresponds to
  :math:`a_x a_x a_x`,
  where **a** is a vector describing particle position. Conversion to the Cartesian form
  is conducted within LibEFP or GAMESS codes.
- The section ends with mandatory ``STOP`` line.

In the example below, ``$FRAGNAME`` (``$nh3`` in this case), ``COORDINATES``, ``MONOPOLES``,
``DIPOLES``, ``QUADRUPOLES``, ``OCTUPOLES`` sections are highlighted.

  between EFP fragments (``SCREEN2``).
- Both sections are optional.
- Each line contains name tag and :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` parameters that
  effectively screen EFP electronic charges.

  For QM-EFP interactions (``SCREEN``):
  :math:`q_A \rightarrow _A(1-\alpha \exp(-\beta (r_A-r_e)^2))`,
  where :math:`r_e` is position of an electron.

  For EFP-EFP interactions (``SCREEN2``):
  :math:`q_A \rightarrow _A(1-\alpha \exp(-\beta (r_A-r_B)))`,
  where :math:`r_B` is position of another charge.

  :math:`\alpha` parameters in both cases are typically set to 1.

- ``SCREEN`` and ``SCREEN2`` sections are typically found in the very end of `.efp` file,
  even though exact placement of sections can be varied by user.
- Name tags should match those in ``COORDINATES`` section.
- Sections can contain less atoms/bond midpoints than ``COORDINATES`` section.
- Each section ends with mandatory ``STOP`` line.

- The section is optional.
- Format: first line contains PROJECTION WAVEFUNCTION keyword, :math:`N_{loc}`-  number of the localized occupied orbitals
  (core orbitals are excluded), :math:`N_{basis}` size of the basis set. The following lines provide orbital coefficients for
  each orbital. Each line contains orbital number, line number for the given orbital,
  five orbital coefficients not separated by comma. These entries are format sensitive!
- The number of orbital entries should match :math:`N_{loc}` (the first number in the first line).
- The number of orbital coefficients for each orbital should match :math:`N_{basis}`
  (the second number in the first line).
- Note: the section does not require ``STOP`` line.

.. _FOCK:

  in the localized basis. It is used in computing exchange-repulsion energy and overlap-based electrostatic and
  dispersion dampings.
- The section is optional.
- The Fock matrix is given in the lower triangular form, i.e., the matrix
  :math:`\begin{pmatrix}
  a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}\\
  a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}\\
  a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}

  :lines: 328-360
  :emphasize-lines: 1, 3, 24, 28

.. _POLAB:

``POLAB``
^^^^^^^^^

- ``POLAB`` is a keyword specifying a short-range polarization damping parameter for the fragment.
- The section is optional.
- This section is not included in the `.efp` as prepared by the MAKEFP run and should be added manually if needed.
- The section format is:
  ``POLAB value``, followed by the mandatory ``STOP`` line,
  where ``value`` is the user-specified value of the parameter.
- Default value is 0.6.

Some wisdom on a choice of the POLAB parameter:

- polab = 0.6 (default) - works well for the majority of neutral solvents;
- polab = 0.3 might improve stability of BioEFP calculations in proteins, especially relevant for charged amino acids;
- polab = 0.1 was shown to work safely for anions like F-, Cl-, etc;
- polab = 0.1 might be useful for large aromatics like porphyrins and chlorophylls
  (their polarizabilities are huge and orbital localization schemes often struggle, resulting in very large ~100 a.u.
  polarizabilities on some sites);
- polab = 0.03 for Li+, Na+ and Mg2+.
